<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Off and on throughout my life, Iâ€™ve operated a few blogs.
    My passion for blogging started when my brother and I started a humor blog in 2004.
    It started out as just a way for us to share funny pictures of cats with our family and friends.
    Then we discovered the amazing tool known as google analytics.
    I got incredibly addicted to the act of creating a post, and immediately being able to track whether it was something people were interested in or not.</p>

<p>Recently, I have started posting tech blogs. </p>
